This is my project for SoftUni ReactJS course.

The idea is for the user to be able to search for an anime, see details about it, add it to his profile and keep track of the episodes watched. There is also a forum where users can discuss different topics.

The project uses the React library for the front end and firebase as db and authentication.
For for form validation I use yup library.
